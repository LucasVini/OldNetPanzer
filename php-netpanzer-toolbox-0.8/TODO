// netPanzer - game - browser in php - TODO

 - For me more useful would be number of free/owned outposts in general and for every player. + time to the end of the round
 - Add logparsing capabilities.

// DONE:
 - Create FlagID to flagname converter.
 - Add map-info page (Map image, number/names of outposts, number of spawns).
 - Add caching information to getimage.php .
